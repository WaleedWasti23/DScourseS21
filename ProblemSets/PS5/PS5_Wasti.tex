Tell me about the data. What about it
interests you? Will it be useful to you at some point in the future? Did you use
any online tutorials to help you parse the data? If so, which ones? \\

Ans. \\
This data shows the names of the record goal scorers in the English Premier League. I just wanted to know what is the nationality of majority of the top scorers. It is interesting to note that out of the top 10 goalscorers in the EPL, 8 belong to the United Kingdom! And out of the 2 non-natives, one (Sergio Aguero) is still playing in the Premier League. This indicates that the positions in this table could be changing sooner rather than later.\\

Another very important statistic is the ratio of goals per game. \\\\

\item
Tell me about what you found in the data (if anything) that was interesting or useful to you. What packages did you use (if any)? \\

Ans. \\
I actually wanted to look at the recent surge in unemployment due to Covid and how it compared to the peaks in unemployment in the past. The unemployment percentage in 2020 is as high as it has ever been (since around 1940 at least). But the recovery rate it seems soon after that has been better than it ever was! This is pretty interesting. I used the packages httr, listviewer and lubridate to plot the following graph for unemployment: \\
